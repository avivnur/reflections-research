Reflection:
- LLaVA-Interactive is a cost-efficient system that combines pre-built AI models for visual chat, image segmentation, and image generation/editing, without the need for additional model training. 
- The system supports multi-turn dialogues with users, taking multimodal inputs and generating multimodal responses. It goes beyond language prompts by enabling visual prompts to align human intents in the interaction.
- While the paper mentions a diverse set of application scenarios, there is no scenarios for visualization chart types.

Technology used:
- LLM: LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) - the first open-source alternative to GPT-4V
- Language for Front End: Gradio
