Notes:
- The VL2NL framework introduced in the paper facilitates the creation of diverse natural language datasets for data visualization, significantly advancing the development of Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) by synthesizing chart semantics and generating accurate captions. 
- This innovation not only enhances accessibility for individuals with visual impairments but also promises to improve NLI research through its ability to generate a wide range of utterances and its potential for generalization across various types of NL datasets.
